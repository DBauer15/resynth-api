# resynth-api

This project unifies two popular repositories for image resynthesis under a single C api.

The original projects can be found here:
https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer
https://github.com/notwa/resynth 

This API interfaces with both implementations. Since different versions support different features, not everything is supported.
